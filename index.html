        <div class="subheading mb-5">Teacherüìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a freshman who studied at the University of California in Riverside. I am an international student who came from China. In order to have a wide sight for the future, I choose to study outside of my mother country. Teaching is one of my hobbies because I love to play with the kids and want to teach them how to be well in the future. Since I am in the first year of high school, I tried to go to volunteer in a small village in China, Guizhou. I don‚Äôt know other‚Äôs attitudes towards volunteering in a small poor village, for me, it is a pleasure to teach kids, play with them and make friends with them. 
        At first, we did not have enough experience to work as a teacher, we just bring our passion and enthusiasm to the kids. Actually, we are not even a formal group with the regular permit to teach, we organize because of our love and we want to change something. The village kids are lack teachers and family teaching, we hope our existence will change their future in some way. Therefore, serval of us finds this small beautiful village which in the high mountain and only car can enter into.  <br><br>

        For the first year volunteer as a teacher, it is new for inexperienced teachers how to teach. Hence, I organized them and teach them who to prepare the class, what should we prepare and how can we get attention from the students who don‚Äôt like to study. Maybe the small class I took to teach them cannot makes lots of effort into their real teaching, but I believe it will take a little advantage in their first class.
        In the end, we scheduled all classes we will teach before we go; we make sure all classes are well-prepared; we make sure the gift we will send to kids is enough‚Ä¶ We used 2 months to prepare all staff, although the activity was only 10 days. I really enjoy the process to lead my group, also I enjoy the final experience we learned from the volunteering.<br><br>

        I used three of my summer vacation to play with those kids, teaching might not the real purpose I work for, however, I think the biggest gain I got from my little students is the heart of them. Keep volunteering in the same place are not easy, and I am the only two who persist in here for three years. I like to play with them and use my free time with them, some of the students want to play games with me, I agree; some students want to eat with me, I agree. I used all of my free time on them and try to teach them the real heart of myself. To be honest, not all of the teachers will do those things, everyone has their own benefit which makes people selfish. I am likely to call this ‚Äúvocation‚Äù, rather than ‚Äúvolunteering as a teacher‚Äù. Because I think it is my pleasure to play with kids, teach kids to want they want to know, it is my pleasure to become a teacher to real teaching some staff.
